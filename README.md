# 🌟 Code Everyday

**Code Everyday** is my personal challenge: doing at least one coding exercise every single day.  
I practice using the languages I master — **Java, JavaScript, Python, Dart, and SQL** — to strengthen problem-solving skills, explore new ideas, and keep improving as a fullstack developer.

## 📖 Overview

`code-everyday` is a collection of **daily coding exercises** across multiple programming languages.  
It aims to solve the challenge of **staying consistent and sharp as a developer** by providing:

- ✅ A **daily exercise log** to track progress
- ✅ **Multi-language solutions** (Java, JavaScript, Python, Dart, SQL)
- ✅ A space to **experiment with problem-solving techniques**
- ✅ A resource for others who want to practice and get inspired

---

## 🎯 Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/10Glo/code-everyday.git
   cd code-everyday
   ```

## 🏆 Problem Levels

To make progression clear, each exercise is tagged with a **difficulty level**:

- 🟢 **Basic** → Entry-level problems (conditions, loops, simple input/output)
- 🟡 **Intermediate** → More logic involved (data structures, algorithms, multiple steps)
- 🔴 **Advanced** → Complex use of algorithms, optimization, real-world use cases
- ⚫ **Expert (Hard)** → Challenging problems requiring deep algorithmic thinking or system design

This way, learners can start small and grow step by step 🚀

## 📊 Problem Categories

Exercises are also grouped into categories for better navigation:

- 🔢 **Numbers** → Math-related problems (primes, divisibility, arithmetic rules)
- 📜 **Classic Algorithms** → Sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming
- 🌐 **Graph** → Traversals, shortest path, connected components
- 📦 **Data Structures** → Stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, hashmaps
- ✍️ **Text** → Strings, regex, parsing, text processing
- 🌍 **Networking** → Socket programming, requests, APIs
- 🏷️ **Classes** → OOP concepts (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)
- 🔄 **Threading** → Concurrency, parallelism, synchronization
- 🌐 **Web** → Frontend/backend mini challenges
- 📂 **Files** → File input/output, serialization, logs
- 🗄️ **Databases** → SQL queries, normalization, joins
- 🎨 **Graphics and Multimedia** → Drawing, images, UI-related problems
- 🔒 **Security** → Hashing, encryption, authentication concepts

This categorization helps anyone jump directly to the type of challenge they want to practice 💡

⚠️ **Note for learners**: To truly sharpen your problem-solving skills, try solving each exercise **without relying on AI at first**.  
Use your own logic, experiment, and refine your approach. AI can be a great tool — but use it **only at the end** to:
- ✅ Compare your solution with alternatives
- ✅ Test whether your algorithm is optimal
- ✅ Learn new techniques after attempting the problem yourself

This way, you’ll **upgrade your thinking process** while still benefiting from AI as a final mentor.
