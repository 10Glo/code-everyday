# 🌟 Code Everyday

**Code Everyday** is my personal challenge: doing at least one coding exercise every single day.  
I practice using the languages I master — **Java, JavaScript, Python, Dart, and SQL** — to strengthen problem-solving skills, explore new ideas, and keep improving as a fullstack developer.

💡 *“Consistency beats intensity. One exercise a day keeps stagnation away.”*

⚠️ **Note for learners**: To truly sharpen your problem-solving skills, try solving each exercise **without relying on AI at first**.  
Use your own logic, experiment, and refine your approach. AI can be a great tool — but use it **only at the end** to:
- ✅ Compare your solution with alternatives
- ✅ Test whether your algorithm is optimal
- ✅ Learn new techniques after attempting the problem yourself

This way, you’ll **upgrade your thinking process** while still benefiting from AI as a final mentor.
